# Beacon Spam using ESP32

This project demonstrates how to send custom Wi-Fi beacon frames using an ESP8266 board to simulate fake access points. It can be used for **educational**, **penetration testing**, or **Wi-Fi security awareness** purposes.

> ⚠️ For educational and ethical hacking purposes only. Do not use this code to disrupt networks without permission.

## 🔧 Features

- Sends multiple fake Wi-Fi access points (SSID spam)
- Easily customizable SSID list
- Lightweight and fast beacon frame generation

## 🧰 Requirements

- **ESP8266** (e.g., NodeMCU, Wemos D1 Mini)
- Arduino IDE installed
- ESP8266 board support added to Arduino IDE
- [ESP8266WiFi.h](https://arduino-esp8266.readthedocs.io/) and other dependencies

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Connect your ESP32 to your PC.
2. Open `Beacon_Spam.ino` in the Arduino IDE.
3. Install necessary libraries if prompted.
4. Upload the sketch to the ESP8266.
5. Monitor the serial output for debug information.

## 📁 File Info
